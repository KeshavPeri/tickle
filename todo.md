# TICKle TODO

## Gift-ready polish (highest priority)
- [ ] UI polish: fix stacking/spacing issues (especially on mobile Safari)
- [ ] UI polish: increase small font sizes for readability + unify typography scale
- [ ] UI polish: overall look & feel refinement (cleaner, less “technical”)

## Hints UX
- [ ] Move Hints panel below Clues and restyle it like “Optional • casual” (pill buttons + logo preview box)
- [ ] Hints: improve “used” state styling (e.g., filled/active instead of only disabled)

## Win feedback (delight)
- [ ] On solve: change flipped ticker boxes background to green
- [ ] On solve: show a “Correct!” banner after the last letter flip finishes

## Content improvements
- [ ] Top news: add clickable article links (keep as later step)
- [ ] Reveal card: clean formatting + better hierarchy (less dense)

## Chart improvements (later)
- [ ] Improve chart accuracy + granularity (more data points, better scaling)
- [ ] Improve chart rendering (thinner stroke, nicer interpolation)

## Data & automation (later)
- [ ] Expand stock universe toward ~400 (US-only; weight AI/semis/cloud)
- [ ] Add a simple data generation workflow for snapshots (template + guardrails)
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions scheduled updater (daily rotation + data refresh via free APIs)
- [ ] Add archive mode (play missed days)

## Optional personalization
- [ ] Special days: theme/message toggle switch (off by default for public sharing)
